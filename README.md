lol i have no idea how to host a visual studio project on github haha dont laugh


# BuildAndShootLauncher2

An extended replication of the original Build and Shoot Launcher by StackOverflow, with a serverlist, a mods manager, and more!

##Compiling
BuildAndShootLauncher2 requires Newtonsoft JSON, also I have no idea how Visual Studio project files work, so I only included the .csproj file for now.

##TODO
- Multiversion support
- Add controls manager in the setup menu
- Finish Community section

##Known Caveats
- Selected mod text does not work
- Selectable versions are not supported yet
- Deleting words in the Search bar may not properly update the list, for now simply refresh the server list
- Refreshing the server list may inconveniently change your selection

also i'm still new to this c sharp stuff so bare in mind that there is a lot of bugs and weird conventions
